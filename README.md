# RPEP_documentation
Welcome!

This is the repository for the research project course in the 1st Masters at Ghent University.
Here you can find the code to run the experiment, the code for analyses, stimuli and the data.

The code is programmed in such a way that the directory should not be adapted. However, be sure to check the directory if anything is not working correctly.

In the [Analyses](https://github.com/QuinnCabooter/RPEP_documentation/tree/main/Analyses) folder, the main document is [R_Analyses](https://github.com/QuinnCabooter/RPEP_documentation/blob/main/Analyses/R_Analyse.R).
