# RPEP_documentation
Welcome!

This is the repository for the research project course in the 1st Masters at Ghent University.
Here you can find the code to run the experiment, the code for analyses, stimuli and the data.

The code is programmed in such a way that the directory should not be adapted. However, be sure to check the directory in lines where stimuli are implemented if anything is not working correctly. The experiment is programmed and conducted in Psychopy3. 

In the [Analyses](https://github.com/QuinnCabooter/RPEP_documentation/tree/main/Analyses) folder, the main document is [R_Analyses](https://github.com/QuinnCabooter/RPEP_documentation/blob/main/Analyses/R_Analyse.R). Dowloading the folder as a zip should be able to run the code. Again, if anything is not working correctly, be sure to check if the directories are correct.

If anything remain unclear, don't hesitate to contact me for questions.

Yours truly

Quinn
